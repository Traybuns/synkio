# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## Payments & Transactions

### How does Synkio protect my payments?

Every payment moves into a neutral escrow wallet as soon as you approve the order. Funds stay there until you mark the item received, so nobody can disappear with your money.

### How do I send money out of my account?

Just tell Synkio who to pay and how much. You'll confirm with your password for security, and we handle the rest. You can send to anyone—even if they don't have a Synkio account yet. They'll receive a link to claim the payment. No wallet addresses or technical steps needed.

**How it works:**
1. Tell Synkio: "Send $50 to john@example.com" or "Pay 0.1 ETH to merchant"
2. Confirm the amount and recipient
3. Enter your password to authorize the transaction
4. Synkio processes the payment securely
5. Recipient receives the funds (or a claim link if they're not a user)

**Security:**
- All send operations require your password
- Your password is never stored in plaintext
- Failed authentication attempts are rate-limited
- You'll receive notifications for all transactions

### Are there any fees?

Browsing is free. When you approve an order we show a small service fee that covers the escrow and support team—you always see it before confirming.

### What happens if there's a dispute?

Open a dispute inside the chat and our team reviews the conversation, photos, and delivery proof. Money stays on hold until we help both sides land on a fair outcome.

Your Synkio guide can provide your wallet address and funding instructions at any time.

## Vendors & Marketplace

## Technical Details

### What blockchain does Synkio use?

Synkio primarily uses Base network (a Layer 2 solution on Ethereum) for fast, low-cost transactions. We also support Ethereum and Solana with automatic routing.

### Can I use my own wallet?

Currently, Synkio uses custodial wallets for the best user experience. This means we securely manage your wallet keys so you don't need to worry about technical details. Your funds are always accessible with your password.

### What happens if I forget my password?

Password recovery is currently in development. For now, please keep your password secure. If you lose access, contact support for assistance with account recovery.
